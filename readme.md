<H2> UCSC Mock Interview Program : Data Science Challenge </H2> 

Hi Potential interviewee! For this data science challenge you will be tasked with a smaller version of one of the common data science challenges that occur during the interview phase for data scientist positions in industry.

In this challenge you will work with the Chicago crime dataset and your task will be to do a multiclass classifier based on the <b> Primary Type </b> variable as your prediction target. 

The data for this challenge can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2018/3i3m-jwuy). This is the data for 2018, and you can download it in the format you feel most comfortable working with. 

You are not required to submit anything, since you will be presenting the results of the task in your mock interview. So upload the materials you want (Jupyter notebooks, slides) to use to show the results of your task if you want me to take a look before your interview. This task should take you a few hours, and was calculated to be done in a day of work tops. That being said, feel free to spend as little or much time as you want on it.  

Here are some tips that can help you excel at this task. 
<ul>
	<li> <b> Play your strenghts :</b> If you're really good at a specific skill (visualization, XAI,...) try to showcase it in the presentation materials.</li>
	<li> <b> Don't Obsess over Metrics :</b> Showing the insights you learned from the task is much more important than getting the best model performance metric. Data Science is all about insights.</li>
	<li> <b> Show your thought process :</b> Show every thought you have about the task when presenting. We are interested in how you attack the problem in this type of interview. So showcasing your assumptions, your data exploration, and explaining why you chose a certain model matter the most.</li>
	<li> <b> It's okay to not know something:</b> Honesty goes a long way, it's more important to say "I don't know but I can learn this" than to lie about skills.</li>
	<li> <b> Don't over think it:</b> It's better to have a simple solution that works, than something over engineered that doesn't.</li>
</ul>
